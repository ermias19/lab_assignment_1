            <p style="color: black;">Ems are a relative measure of length. The size of an em is relative to the font-size of its parent element
                a 'div' with the font size is set to 16px, and a 'p' element inside that div with a font-size set to 2em, the font-size of text in the 'p' will be 32px; set it to 0.5px, and the font-size will be 8px.
                and when the object is chanched it dosent change its compatable through a different objects.

                Explain in detail(in technical terms) the specific changes in css3 

                <article>
            </p>
            <p style="color: black;">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language that is used to illustrate the look, style, and format of a document written in any markup language. In simple words, it is used to style and organize the layout of Web pages. CSS3 is the latest version of an earlier CSS version, CSS2.

                A significant change in CSS3 in comparison to CSS2 is the introduction of modules. The benefit of this functionality is that it allows the specification to be finalized and accept faster, as segments are finalized and accepted in portions. Also, this allows the browser to support segments of the specification.
                
                Some of the key modules of CSS3 are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Box model</li>
                    <li>Image values and replaced content</li>
                    <li>Text effects</li>
                    <li>Selectors</li>
                    <li> Animations</li>
                   </ul>
                   <h3 align="center" style="text-decoration: underline;" >difference between css and css3 in technical term</h3>
                   Both CSS vs CSS3 are popular choices in the market; let us discuss some of the major Difference Between CSS vs CSS3:
                   <ul>
                       <li>The main difference between CSS and CSS3 is that CSS3 has modules.CSS is the basic version and it does not support responsive design. CSS3, on the other hand, is the latest version and supports responsive design.</li>
                        <br>
                       <li>CSS cannot be split into modules but CSS3 can be split in modules. Being an older version of CSS is slower than CSS3.</li>
                       <br>
                       <li>In addition to these CSS3 has many alignment features. CSS3 provides a box-sizing tool which allows the user to get the correct size of any element without making any changes in dimensions or padding of the element. CSS does not have any box-sizing tool and hence the user needs to use the standard procedures defined to align text.</li>
                       <br>
                       <li>The animations and 3D transformations are better in CSS3. Elements can be moved on the screen with the help of flash and JavaScript. Using this the elements will also be able to change their size and color. All kinds of transitions, transformations, and animations can be done using CSS3. CSS does not provide 3D animation and transformations.</li>
                       <br>
                       <li>CSS provides basic color schema and standard colors. CSS3 supports RGBA, HSLA, HSL and gradient colours. It also supports rounded image corners for text boxes.</li>
                       <br>
                       <li>Multi-column text blocks can be defined in CSS3. CSS only supports single text blocks.s</li>
                   </ul>
                </p>
